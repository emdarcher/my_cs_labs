-> Residencial 1 2332998 0 987 Wyrd wey

Property id: 0  Address: 423 Thalmage Street  Rental  Estimated value: 234500  occupied

these two addresses should be in this order:
423 Thalmage Street
423 Thomas Avenue 
to test proper sorting of the string after the number in the address

in the computation of the taxes, the input from line 5:
-> Commercial 1 2349.2 0 0.70 221 Angled Way
should not compute any discount in the output
